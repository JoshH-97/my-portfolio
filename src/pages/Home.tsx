        <p>
          Iâ€™m a junior developer, with experience in the frontend (hopefully full stack someday) and enjoy creating an enjoyable user experience. 
          When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably enjoying: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching 22 guys kick around a ball (Man Utd)</li>
            <li>Getting excited over 10 cars driving in circles (F1) </li>
            <li>Watching a new film, tv show or even some anime</li>
            <li>Playing games on my PC (As expected of a dev)</li>
            <li>Falling into the rabbithole of my spotify playlists pretending I can even sing 1% as good</li>
            <li>Looking for the latest model to print on my 3D printer </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
